This is the implementation of Dijkstra`s algorithm and Kruskal algorithm for the graph defined in data.txt

E D 9
Here, the first two numbers represent the number of vertices and edges. The letter D stands for
Directed Acyclic graph. This letter might be U meaning undirected graph. From the second line on we have edges and its weight (e.g. edge(A,B) and its weight is 10. The last line is optional. If given, it represents the source node.
------------------
Input
-----
Run the graph.py. 
Dijkstra`s - The code will find the shortest path and print the cost table and paths involved.
Kruskal - The code will find the minimum spanning tree and print all the nodes involved in minimum spanning tree as a set.
