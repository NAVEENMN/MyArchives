In this project different sorting algorithms have been implemented. It includes Merge sort, Heap sort,
Quick sort, Modified Quick sort, Insertion sort.
For Quick sort first element is used as a pivot and for modified quick sort median of three logic is used
to find the pivot. In case of modified quick sort when size drops below 10 insertion sorting technique is
implemented.
INPUT: the program automatically takes input list of random numbers in sizes varying from 100 to
4000 over a step of 500. So, user has no need to manually enter the input
The program automatically finds the sorted list and reverse sorted list to find execution time for for
same input by different algorithms.
OUTPUT: since list if size 4000 covers up the screen the program doesn't display the sorted list.
However, the user can uncomment the required print statement to see the result.
The output is graphically displayed using Three images,
1) for original input
2) for sorted input
3) for reverse sorted input
