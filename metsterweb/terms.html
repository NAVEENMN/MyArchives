<p class="p5"><b>12. Subscriptions; Charges on Your Billing Account.</b></p>
<p class="p5">(a) General. Datemyschool.com bills you through an online account (your "Billing Account") for use of the Service. You agree to pay Datemyschool.com all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize Datemyschool.com to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. Datemyschool.com reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>
<p class="p5">(b) Recurring Billing. Most subscription plans to the Service consist of an initial period, for which there is a one time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. DATEMYSCHOOL.COM MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (CONFIRMED IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY DATEMYSCHOOL.COM) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE DATEMYSCHOOL.COM REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.</p>
<p class="p5">(c) Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY DATEMYSCHOOL.COM IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE DATEMYSCHOOL.COM ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT DATEMYSCHOOL.COM MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE (CONFIRMED BY YOU IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY DATEMYSCHOOL.COM).</p>
<p class="p5">(d) Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method (the "Payment Method Provider"). If Datemyschool.com does not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>
<p class="p5">(e) Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and Datemyschool.com shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your Payment Method Provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that Datemyschool.com may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>
<p class="p5">(f) Auto-renewal. Your Datemyschool.com subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate. Auto-renewal also applies to deactivated accounts. To change, resign or delete your subscription at any time, go to Account Settings. If you resign or delete, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won't be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. Recurring charges are eligible for refunds in certain cases. This is assuming the user has no activity on their account and the user has notified DMS Network within the current subscription period. All refunds for recurring charges are issued at the discretion of DMS Network, Inc. and all refunds will be issued with a 10% processing fee. All first-time online purchases from DMS Network, Inc. are final and non-refundable.</p>
<p class="p5">(g) Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Datemyschool.com is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Datemyschool.com may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Datemyschool.com's right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Service.</p>
<p class="p5">(h) Free Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion that provides a paying subscriber-level access to the Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must cancel your subscription before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged a subscription fee. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact Datemyschool.com to have the charges reversed.</p>
