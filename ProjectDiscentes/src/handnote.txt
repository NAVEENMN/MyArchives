///////////////////////////////
lets slip the app view like this
one tap entires screen fills with one icon then the user has to slide his fingre
to move next or just tap once more all icons come in the entire screen.
we will have a cool live wallpaper in the background (but lets check with the hardware capablity later).

I am going start with home screen first. the start up screen will be done later. first task is a neat user interfce. but now lets keep that a aside and build a backbone. since the system has to hold huge opertaions we need to optimize each and everything. 

I will first start will the music. sice people love music. I will give a neat user interface to give a very neat user expreiunce. 

 the tradinitional user interface the apple nokia and any ipad uses is mundane. the use has to "navigate or type to get music"!!! 
 
 I will introduce "3D" navigation for music!! neatly categoraized.
 
 OK!! let the hack begin!!
