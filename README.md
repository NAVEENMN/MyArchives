This the project done as part of my course requirement for Algorithms and data structures class at UNCC
Spring 2015

This is the implementation of finding longest common subsequence by

• Normalized Edit Distance Algorithm
• LCS Algorithm – stores the entire table
• LCS Algorithm – linear memory recursive version

1. Implementation of the algorithm for normalized edit distance.
This function takes two sequences and computes the normalized edit distance between them.
This function uses only two rows so that the table is not stored in memory.

functions used : 

2. Implementation of the LCS algorithm that stores the entire table.
This function computes and returns the longest common subsequence of two sequences. This
function is implemented using the basic dynamic programming algorithm that stores the entire table in memory.

3. Implementation of the LCS algorithm that uses linear memory.
This function computes and returns the longest common subsequence of two sequences. This
function is implemented using the recursive linear memory algorithm.
