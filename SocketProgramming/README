Server Client model for ITCS 6166/8166 Spring 2014 Project
=========================================================

This a Server Clinet model program implemented in python as part of a cerdit requirement in
ITCS 6166/8166 Spring 2014 Project at UNC Charlotte.

This document explains how to run these files and the proper commands assosiated.
It also gives insight of what these diffent files and folder does.

Running the files
--------------
Run the server.py in a terminal in this format

root@ubuntu:~/networking/client$python server.py [port number]

pick a port number which is sufficiently high and doesn`t disturb existing ports.

example:

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/server$ python server.py 8000 

This should start the server at port 8000 and it starts to listen to incoming client request.

Now in seperate terminal run client.py in this format

GET request
--------------
root@ubuntu:~/networking/client$python client.py [IP address/host name] [port number] GET [filename]

This should make a get request to the server and pull the file requested and display it on the screen.

example:

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py 127.0.0.1 8000 GET index.html

or

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py localhost 8000 GET index.html

This will get the index.html located in server

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py www.google.com 80 GET index.html

This will get the index.html located in google server
note the default port for http request is 80 so we have used port 80. 

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py www.google.com 8000 GET local/newfile.html

This will get the newfile.html located in the local folder of the server.


If the file requested from client is not found on the server then the terminal promts 

404 page not found


PUT request
-------------
Once the server is started it keeps listening to incomming requests, however if the connection breaks run the server again
naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/server$ python server.py 8000 

This should start the server at port 8000 and it starts to listen to incoming client request.

Now in seperate terminal run client.py in this format

root@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py [IP] [PORT] PUT [file address]

this should locate the file in your client and PUT the file in server in the server`s local folder

example:

naveen@ubuntu:~/networking/client$ python client.py 127.0.0.1 8000 PUT local/fileclient.html

in response the client prompts 

found file: local/fileclient.html
200 OK local/newfile.html
 
and server prompts

200 OK local/newfile.html
File created!!

If the file is not found in your client the terminal prompts error saying 
No such file exists
400 Error local/newfile.html

and your server says BAD request

Server folder
--------------

This folder consists server.py which is the main python code
index.html which can be requested from client.py
new folder which holds file.html and this can also be requested by client in GET method by giving path as GET new/file.html

It also holds local folder where all the files that are send from client using PUT method will be held here.
    
Client folder
--------------
The client folder contains client.py which is the main python code
local folder where you can send the file stored here to sever by proper command
PUT local/fileclient.html
